# duck-dbt-demo

This is a demonstration project for the pairing of DuckDB with DBT.

This combination should be good for prototyping.
- DuckDB (a hyper-flexible column-store database) can be used as a kind of 'local data warehouse'
- DBT is a popular data transformation tool for data warehousing purposes
